## **Why Online Privacy Matters**

In today’s digital age, your personal information is more vulnerable than ever. From social media platforms to online shopping, every click, like, and purchase leaves a trail of data. This data can be used by companies, governments, and even malicious actors to track, profile, and exploit you.

**Key Reasons to Care About Online Privacy:**
- **Protect Your Identity:** Prevent identity theft and fraud.
- **Safeguard Your Data:** Keep your personal information out of the wrong hands.
- **Maintain Freedom:** Avoid surveillance and censorship.
- **Control Your Digital Life:** Decide who has access to your information and how it’s used.

coding projects to arrive
I am working on several coding projects related to privacy and security
the first project are windows based kill switches to shutdown an unattended system using two methods
the first will shutdown a system if a certain usb device is unplugged ideally this device will be teathered using a metal lanyard or keyring to a wall, desk of table
the second will be a gyroscope & accelerator based kill switch the idea is thet if your pc is picked up of moved without your knowledge the act or picking up the device will force a system shutdown 
this will be coded in python & micropython and flashed to a microcontroller which has those sensors
the system will listen for movement on the sensors and shutdown (the microcontroller will ideally be tethered to the PC) if its unplugged from pc it will also cause a system shutdown
such code will be open source
thank you
