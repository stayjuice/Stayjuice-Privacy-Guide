## **Why Online Privacy Matters**

In today’s digital age, your personal information is more vulnerable than ever. From social media platforms to online shopping, every click, like, and purchase leaves a trail of data. This data can be used by companies, governments, and even malicious actors to track, profile, and exploit you.

**Key Reasons to Care About Online Privacy:**
- **Protect Your Identity:** Prevent identity theft and fraud.
- **Safeguard Your Data:** Keep your personal information out of the wrong hands.
- **Maintain Freedom:** Avoid surveillance and censorship.
- **Control Your Digital Life:** Decide who has access to your information and how it’s used.
